- **Educational Content**: Learn about atomic components and their properties
- **Knowledge Quiz**: Test your understanding of atomic structure concepts
- **Responsive Design**: Works on both desktop and mobile devices

## Technologies Used

- React 18
- HTML5 Canvas for atom visualizations
- CSS3 with modern styling and animations
- Font Awesome icons
- React Hooks (useState, useEffect, useRef)
